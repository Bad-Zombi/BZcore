proficiency system... a users starts with 0xp in each weapon (possibly other things too)
as user gets more hits/kills with the item their xp goes up and they gain levels.
lowest levels have a chance of accident like blowing self up with c4 or setting it wrong... shooting self in the foot etc.
once user hits a "mid" level their damage gets increased as they add new levels.
( start at -100xp   mid level is 0xp  damage increases up to +100xp)

when a player dies if they are below o0x nothing changes... if they are above 0px they lose half of their extra xp.

(user has -20 xp and they die... they start at -10xp  || user as +50xp and they die, they restart with +25 xp)

earning of xp slows the higher they get over 0xp

this could apply to hunting where they get bonus meat or something the better a hunter they are (aside from increased damage)

possibly do it for gathering as well so they gather faster or get more resources from a node.

maybe the same system could be used for picking locks?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

lockpicking...

a user has a lockpick in their belt and face a door. they type /pick ## where ## is between 1 and 100

the system comes up with a secret value range (e.g. 20 - 30)

if the users number is between those values, the door will open.

if using the proficiency system the secret number range is larger up to a 50% value?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

rewrite arrow system fo animal instances are tracked. you can only reclaim arrows that have actually been fired into that animal.

when a player is hit with arrows the datastore will track what time it happened... if it was within 10 minutes or so the arrow can be reclaimed when they die.

if possible put arrows in dropped pack rather than just giving them directly to the player... should be easiest for reds and players... maybe see if animals can drop packs.

if possible make it so animals give arrows back as harvest items.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

when a player destroys a building part with explosives or pickaxe or whatever they will reclaim a percentage of the raw materials used to make the item

when they remove their own item they will have a chance of getting the whole thing or a higher percentage of getting resources back.

possibly tie in with proficiency syste... the more you have built the more you will get back and/or the higher the chance of getting back a whole item.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

make a purchaseable trap setup... when created, user must have appropriate number of credits in inventory or wallet or whatever.

player tags a storage box or stash that is sitting on a ceiling (maybe can work for doors too for blowing them up or opening/picking them)

when a player other than them opens or destroys the stash or door the related ceiling vanishes for like 3 seconds and then is replaced... means user can place a trap room or spikes or something underneath it... 

would work best with doors since the storage sitting on the ceiling would probably be destroyed in the process and may not be recreatable easily with the same instance id

possible scenario... stand in front of door and type /settrap ... targeted door will open and close of owned by user.  user then must "hit" the activated ceiling object with a melee weapon to identify it. 

trap is saved in the traps datastore unded door instance... each trap will get a random number of uses. once its all used up, the user will get a notification of some sort.

------

close all doors at certain times?

open all doors when a user is banned?
